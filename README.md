# 10-4

## Description
An app that allows drivers on the road talk to each other in real time

Have you ever wanted to talk to other drivers on the road to tell them to have a great day? Or maybe one day you're on a road trip and there's no  service available and to coordinate where to go while you're on the road. This is where 10-4 comes into play. Using the Agora API, you can talk to other users of the app on the road. Choose between multiple channels, log yourself in, and talk into your phone, and listen in to what everyone else is saying. It's like a personal walkie-talkie, but with a larger range.

## Software Used
